# Install App

The Install App button appears on volunteer pages when the `beforeinstallprompt`
event fires or on iOS devices. On iOS, selecting the button shows instructions
for using Safari's **Add to Home Screen** option.

## Localization

Add the following translation strings to locale files:

- `install_app` – label for the Install App button.
- `help.install_app.title` – help topic title.
- `help.install_app.description` – description for installing the web app and its offline benefits.
- `help.install_app.steps.0` – instructs users to click Install App when the button appears.
- `help.install_app.steps.1` – tells iOS users to open in Safari and use Add to Home Screen.
