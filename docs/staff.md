# Staff management

Staff accounts can be granted access to different areas of the system.

The staff dashboard includes a pantry visit trend line chart showing monthly totals for clients, adults, and children.

From Client Management, searching for a numeric client ID that isn't found shows an "Add Client" shortcut. Clicking the button opens the Add tab with the ID prefilled.
