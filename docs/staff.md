# Staff management

Staff accounts can be granted access to different areas of the system.

The staff dashboard includes a pantry visit trend line chart showing monthly totals for clients, adults, and children.

From Client Management, searching for a numeric client ID that isn't found shows an "Add Client" shortcut. Clicking the button opens the Add tab with the ID prefilled.

## Delivery accounts and requests

- Assign the **Delivery** role from **Staff → Client Management → Add Client** when setting up a delivery shopper.
- Delivery options are controlled from **Admin → Settings → Pantry**. Update delivery categories and items there so the Book Delivery page stays in sync.
- Submit requests on behalf of clients from **Pantry → Deliveries → Record Delivery**. The form mirrors `/delivery/book`, requires address and phone confirmation, and offers optional email collection.
- Review [docs/delivery.md](delivery.md) for the complete request flow, notification email details, and guidance on helping delivery clients.
