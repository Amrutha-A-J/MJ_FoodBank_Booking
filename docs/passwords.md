# Password visibility toggle

Password fields include an eye icon that lets users show or hide the typed value.


## Password setup identifier

The password setup page now displays the account identifier from the token.
Client tokens show the **Client ID** while staff and volunteer tokens show the
associated **Email** address.

## Role-specific login reminder

After fetching token details, the password setup page shows a message directing
users to the correct login screen for their role and provides a button linking
to that page.
