# Maintenance Mode

Admin users can schedule downtime and toggle maintenance mode from **Admin â†’ Maintenance**.
When active, maintenance mode prevents normal access and shows a message to clients. Staff can still sign in to disable maintenance.
A scheduled window displays an upcoming maintenance banner to clients.
