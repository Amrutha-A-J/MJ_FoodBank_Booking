# Warehouse Aggregations

The Warehouse Aggregations page shows donor totals and yearly overall statistics for the warehouse.
Staff can use the **Insert Aggregate** button on the Donor tab to manually add or update monthly totals for a donor, and the same button on the Yearly Overall tab to edit overall monthly totals.

Add the following translation strings to locale files:

- `insert_aggregate` â€“ Insert Aggregate button text
