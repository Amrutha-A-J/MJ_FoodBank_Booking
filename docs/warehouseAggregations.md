# Warehouse Aggregations

The Warehouse Aggregations page shows donor totals and yearly overall statistics for the warehouse. Staff with `aggregations` or `donor_management` access can also open **Aggregations â†’ Food Bank Trends** for a consolidated view of pantry and warehouse metrics when they do not have direct access to those individual tools.
Staff can use the **Insert Aggregate** button on the Donor tab to manually add or update monthly totals for a donor, and the same button on the Yearly Overall tab to edit overall monthly totals.
