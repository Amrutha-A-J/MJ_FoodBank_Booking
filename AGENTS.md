# Development Guide

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure tests are added or updated for any code changes and run the relevant test suites after each task.
- Use Node.js 22+; run `nvm use` to switch to the pinned version in `.nvmrc`.
- Keep recurring-booking tests current in both the backend and frontend whenever this feature changes.
- Update this `AGENTS.md` file and the repository `README.md` to reflect any new instructions or user-facing changes.
- Document translation strings for localization in `docs/` and update `MJ_FB_Frontend/src/locales` when user-facing text is added.
- Pantry visits track daily sunshine bag weights via the `sunshine_bag_log` table.
- Booking notes consist of **client notes** (entered when booking) and **staff notes** (recorded during visits). Staff users automatically receive staff notes in booking history responses, while agency users can include them with `includeStaffNotes=true`.
- Keep `docs/timesheets.md` current with setup steps, API usage, payroll CSV export details, UI screenshots, and translation keys whenever the timesheet feature changes.
- A cron job seeds pay periods for the upcoming year every **Novâ€¯30** using `seedPayPeriods`.
- Deployments are performed manually; follow the steps in the repository `README.md` under "Deploying to Azure".
- Document new environment variables in the repository README and `.env.example` files.
- Implement all database schema changes via migrations in `MJ_FB_Backend/src/migrations`; do not modify `src/setupDatabase.ts` for schema updates.
- Use `write-excel-file` for spreadsheet exports instead of `sheetjs` or `exceljs`.

See `MJ_FB_Backend/AGENTS.md` for backend-specific guidance and `MJ_FB_Frontend/AGENTS.md` for frontend-specific guidance.
