        <Typography variant="h6">1. Purpose</Typography>
        <Typography>
          This Privacy Policy explains how the Moose Jaw & District Food Bank (
          "we," "our," "us") collects, uses, and protects your personal
          information when you use our Harvest Pantry booking app (the "App").
          The App is provided to make booking appointments easier for clients
          already registered in the Link2Feed system.
        </Typography>

        <Typography variant="h6">2. Consent</Typography>
        <Typography>
          When you first registered to use the Food Bank, you gave consent
          through the Link2Feed system for us to collect and use your
          information in order to provide food bank services. The App does not
          collect any new categories of personal information beyond what is
          necessary for booking and managing your visits.

        </Typography>
        <Typography>
